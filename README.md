Coursera-ExploratoryAnalysis-Project
====================================
Project for the Exploratory Data Analysis course on Coursera.

# Using the Code
* Data source must first be downloaded. Link: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip]
* Extract the data source into the directory containing the .R script files.
* Run each .R script by *source()*ing it. The plot will automatically be generated.
** It can take time to read in the dataset. If you want to make all of the plots, I recommend reading in the dataset once (say in plot1.R), then commenting out the read in subsequent scripts (plot2-6.R) when you source them.

# PLEASE NOTE
*I've created a repo for learning purposes only. Coursera students, please don't just blindly copy-paste my code for your own project!*
